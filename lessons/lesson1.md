# Create a Github Student Account and Start a Cloud VM on Github Codespaces

## Objective 1: Create a Github Account with your SMU email ID 

Most of you who have taken the core course `Data Analytics for Economics` will already have this. You can directly skip to Step 2. 

### Github Student Developer Pack Registration

This guide explains how to apply for the Github Student Developer Pack using your SMU email account.

## Objective 2: Start a Cloud VM on Github Codespaces 

Github Codespaces provides a cloud-based VM with a development environment that runs entirely in your browser. So goodbye to all installation hassles ! 

---

### What You Need Before you start

Before creating a Codespace, ensure that:

- You have created a Github account
- You have successfully signed in
- Your Github Student Developer Pack application is approved (recommended)

---

### Open Github Codespaces

Go to: https://github.com/codespaces

---
### Create a New Codespace

Under `Explore quick start templates` choose the `Blank Template` 

Click:
```text
Use this template
```

Wait for the VM to Start
- Github will now create your cloud VM. This may take a few minutes the first time.


---
### Verify the VM Is Running

In the terminal, run:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see a Python version displayed.

Example:

```text
Python 3.12.x
```

### What You Now Have

You now have:
- A cloud-based Linux VM 
- VS Code running in the browser
- A development environment for coding and running applications

This VM runs in the cloud — not on your laptop.

---

### Important Notes

- Closing the browser does not delete your VM
- Your work can be saved and resumed later
- Codespaces automatically manages the development environment for you
- Codespaces will stop the VM after a period of inactivity. This saves cost
